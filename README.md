## Introduction

The project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the lyrics of a song and audio signal processing for evaluating audio features. The data obtained is then fed to machine learning algorithms for predicting the emotions associated with a song. These predictions will then be used to generate customized emojis for users.

## Technologies

The project is created with:

- Python 3.8
- Scikit-learn 0.24
- TensorFlow 2.5
- NLTK 3.6
- Librosa 0.8

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YiChiCanCode/SongEmotionAnalysis.git

# Go into the repository
cd SongEmotionAnalysis

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the program
